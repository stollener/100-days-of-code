# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 6, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning by solving problem. Now solving calculating how many days exist between two dates.

**Thoughts:** It's more complex than I thought. But no problem to solve anyway.

### Day 2: May 7, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Finish coding "calculating days between dates". 

**Thoughts:** It was good for understanding small but essential structure of coding.

### Day 3: May 8, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning basic data structure, which is list. Difference between mutable and immutable.

**Thoughts:** I have a basic knowledge of computer science and coding, but difference between mutable and immutable data structure was interesting enough.

### Day 4: May 9, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning to use for loop with list data. And now get back to web crawler thing (using list to store the url list).

**Thoughts:** I think this online course is great combination of lecture and 'do it by yourself'. More of lecture type, but still good for beginners.
