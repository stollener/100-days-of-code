# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 6, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning by solving problem. Now solving calculating how many days exist between two dates.

**Thoughts:** It's more complex than I thought. But no problem to solve anyway.

### Day 2: May 7, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Finish coding "calculating days between dates". 

**Thoughts:** It was good for understanding small but essential structure of coding.

### Day 3: May 8, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning basic data structure, which is list. Difference between mutable and immutable.

**Thoughts:** I have a basic knowledge of computer science and coding, but difference between mutable and immutable data structure was interesting enough.

### Day 4: May 9, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning to use for loop with list data. And now get back to web crawler thing (using list to store the url list).

**Thoughts:** I think this online course is great combination of lecture and 'do it by yourself'. More of lecture type, but still good for beginners.

### Day 5: May 10, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Coding problems related to crawling urls.

**Thoughts:** I'm stuck in the problem of crawling under max depth restriction. There's a "View Answer" button right under the question, but I'll think deep until tomorrow for waiting good idea coming out of my head.

### Day 6: May 11, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Finish crawling module. Problem sets about checking validation of sudoku, symmetric square, etc.

**Thoughts:** It's not easy to find a solution for each problem set. But it's worth time, and interesting to do.

### Day 7: May 12, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learn about data structure and internet protocol(very basic level). Improve web crawler to have lookup procedure and index to search the url by keyword. Solve various problem sets.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm still cannot think like computer (computational thinking). Coding(solving the problems) are interesting, and I hope it's a small but steady step to be a programmer.

### Day 8: May 13, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** In CS101, learned to make hash table and function for better indexing of data. It improves lookup function much faster than simple list. And in SoloLearn, started to learn basic concepts.

**Thoughts:** It's quite impressive to see way faster lookup using hash function. And actually I already had finished the SoloLearn tutorial months ago, but wanted to remind me of the grammar of Python.

### Day 9: May 14, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Solving many problem sets. - Dictionary exercises. Refactoring (make functions more organized). Memoization (make cache function for repeated calculation). Rotating the letters (using ord() and chr() function).

**Thoughts:** It's still interesting to learn new things. For example, I heard a lot about refactoring from podcast or in the internet, but didn't know what it is. But now, I know basic concept of the term. I already imagine the day I code useful apps or websites.

### Day 10: May 15, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Learning about recursive procedures and PageRank method for best search result.

**Thoughts:** Straight 10 days of learning, I couldn't have done this before! I feel the power of 100 Days of Code project.

### Day 11: May 16, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Solved problem sets regarding recursive procedure.

**Thoughts:** Tough problems, but tried hard to solve them.

### Day 12: May 17, 2018

**Working on:** Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Learn Python grammar with SoloLearn app on the go.

**Thoughts:** Came home from work late at night, and had a no time to code at udacity course.

### Day 13: May 18, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Solved two problem sets (recursively making quick sort procedure), and some lessons about computer science history.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy that I already at 95% of the Udacity course. 100 Days of Code program really helps me.
